# Vehicle Registration Analysis (Azerbaijan)
## Project Overview
This project analyzes the historical trends of initial vehicle registrations in Azerbaijan. By processing and visualizing datasets provided by the Open Data portal of Azerbaijan, this notebook identifies key growth areas in the transportation sector, specifically highlighting the surge in motorcycle and trailer registrations in recent years.

## Dataset
**Source:** opendata.az (State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan).

**Content:** Annual counts for various vehicle categories, including:

- Passenger cars *(Minik avtomobilləri)*

- Trucks *(Yük avtomobilləri)*

 - Buses *(Avtobuslar)*

 - Motorcycles *(Motosikletlər)*

 - Trailers and semi-trailers *(Qoşqu və yarımqoşqular)*

### Key Features of the Analysis
**Data Preprocessing:**

 - Cleaning raw CSV data by removing redundant columns and handling missing values.

 - Normalizing column names for consistency and translating them to Azerbaijani for clarity.

 - Converting numerical data types for accurate mathematical analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

 - Descriptive statistics for different vehicle categories.

 - Time-series visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib to track registration changes from 2005 to 2024.

### Key Insights
 - **Motorcycle Growth:** The analysis identifies a sharp increase in the number of motorcycles and mopeds starting in 2022 and 2023.

 - **Regulatory Drivers:** Findings suggest this growth is tied to new "A1" license requirements and mandatory registration laws for vehicles exceeding 50 km/h.

 - **Economic Drivers:** The post-pandemic delivery explosion (platforms like Wolt, Bolt Food, and Trendyol) contributed significantly to the mass purchase of delivery vehicles.
